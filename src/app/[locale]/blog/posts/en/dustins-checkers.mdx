Have you ever worked on something that was so simple on the surface, yet surprisingly intricate once you dived into it? That's exactly how I felt creating **Dustin's Checkers**. It started as a casual idea—a little web-based version of the classic game we all know. I wanted to brush up on some front-end skills, and what better way to do it than bringing a piece of childhood nostalgia to life?

Building a checkers game seemed like a perfect blend of creativity and logic. You have the colors, the board, the rules—a mix of simplicity and strategy. But let me tell you, it's always the deceptively simple projects that push you the hardest. I thought I'd just set up a board, get some draggable pieces, and call it a day. I couldn't have been more wrong.

The first challenge came with building the board itself. I wanted it to feel right—that satisfying symmetry of a checkers board where the tiles click into place perfectly. I spent hours getting the CSS right, adjusting widths and heights, battling with flexboxes and grids until the board finally had the look I envisioned. The aesthetic wasn't just for me; it was for anyone who played it. I wanted people to feel like they had stepped into a medieval setting, hence the **MedievalSharp** font that added a subtle touch of whimsy.

Next came the game logic. This was where the "simple" part ended. Writing JavaScript to handle the movements, turns, and especially the jumps was like trying to choreograph a dance with partners that had a mind of their own. Pieces needed to recognize valid moves, follow diagonal paths, and sometimes jump over opponents. And then there was the switching of turns—figuring out how to handle not just moving pieces, but making sure the right player had their chance at the board. Writing this part involved a lot of trial and error, a lot of broken moves, and a lot of moments where I'd swear my code had a vendetta against me.

One of my favorite moments was when I finally got the jump logic working—that magical moment where Player 1's red piece hopped over Player 2's black piece and everything behaved the way it was supposed to. It was a simple movement, but to me, it was the culmination of hours of thinking, coding, testing, and a fair bit of yelling at my computer screen. It's funny how these little victories in programming can feel as rewarding as winning an actual game.

Adding in the scoring system came next, and it gave me a new perspective on the thrill of competition. Every time a piece gets captured, the score updates, and I remember how satisfying it was to see those numbers finally change properly. To me, the score wasn't just a feature—it represented progress, both in the game and in my development journey. Seeing those numbers go up reminded me of all the challenges overcome to make that happen.

Of course, no modern web project is complete without thinking about how it looks and feels, so I couldn't leave out some personal branding touches. Adding the contact section at the end felt almost like signing my work. I wanted anyone who played **Dustin's Checkers** to know who built it, to see my journey reflected in those clickable links—to my website, LinkedIn, and GitHub. This was more than just a game; it was a digital piece of me.

Then there was the challenge of getting everything to work smoothly on mobile devices. Adding touch functionality brought its own set of complications. The drag-and-drop interactions that work seamlessly on a desktop often become finicky on a touchscreen. Taps and swipes are trickier to manage compared to precise mouse movements, and making sure pieces move correctly without accidental gestures triggering the wrong actions has been an ongoing battle. It's a work in progress, and I'm still refining the experience to make sure **Dustin's Checkers** feels just as fun and intuitive on mobile as it does on desktop. 

I won't pretend it's a groundbreaking project or that it solves any major problems. But **Dustin's Checkers** is mine. It's a reminder of why I love coding—of the way you can take a simple concept and break it into a thousand little problems that need solving. It's about the satisfaction of seeing something that once lived only in your imagination come to life on the screen, tile by tile, piece by piece.

So, if you ever get the chance, give it a try. Pull up a chair, grab a friend, and lose yourself in a few moves of checkers. As simple as it is, I promise you—behind every red and black piece, there's a story of patience, perseverance, and the love of making things work, even when they seem impossible.
